# 🎯 Skyvern Action System Overview
*Phase 7: Understanding the Core Action Infrastructure*

---

## 📋 What is the Action System?

The **Action System** is the **heart of Skyvern's browser automation**. It defines, executes, and manages all browser interactions that Skyvern can perform.

### Key Components
- **Action Types** - Standardized definitions of what actions can be performed
- **Action Classes** - Implementation of each action type with validation logic
- **Action Handler** - Execution engine that translates actions to browser interactions
- **Action Results** - Response modeling for success/failure handling
- **Action Caching** - Performance optimization through action plan reuse
